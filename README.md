primtive Settlers 3 Bot - Setmaps ONLY

This is a project to program bots for the Settlers 3 SU Edition (Settlers United).
Bots are written in c++ with the Windows API, and are controlled via simulated mouse and keyboard inputs. The Bots have to be hardcoded into the used Map. 

 // Header Files
 The Header Files provided and the program for recording mouse coordinates make the programming of a bot not that much of a painfull process.

 1st menu_functions.h: This is a header that has pre recorded mouse Acions to move into diffrent menus and basic controls are saved here  
 2nd items.h: Items.h provides a variety of smaller submenus in the main Interface  
 3rd timer.h: Timer.h is a class based timer for navigating "timestamps" in the program  

 // Programing  
Programing has to be done by preforming mouse actions for buildings and navigation, each step has to be written down with their exact x and y coordinate

// Recording  
I am currently working on a program which records user Cursor Locations and saves it so it can be copied and doesn't have to be hand or keyboard written

// Available Maps  
The latest project is a 90PT Game for the M-768-6-Metzel_v2 (HG) for the egypt nation
