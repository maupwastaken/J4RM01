primtive Settlers 3 Bot - Setmaps ONLY



This is a project to program bots for the Settlers 3 SU Edition (Settlers United).
Bots are written in c++ with the Windows API, and are controlled via simulated mouse and keyboard inputs. The Bots have to be hardcoded into the used Map. 

 // Usage 
 You should use the header's and the Cursor Recording Program provided to make your own "script"  
 If you want to use an available script on GitHub build and run it...  
 
 // Header Files  
 The Header Files provided and the program for recording mouse coordinates make the programming of a bot not that much of a painfull process.  

 1st menu_functions.h: This is a header that has pre recorded mouse Acions to move into diffrent menus and basic controls are saved here  
 2nd items.h: Items.h provides a variety of smaller submenus in the main Interface  
 3rd timer.h: Timer.h is a class based timer for navigating "timestamps" in the program  

 // Programing  
 Programing has to be done by preforming mouse actions for buildings and navigation, each step has to be written down with their exact x and y coordinate  

// Recording  
I am currently working on a program which records user Cursor Locations and saves it so it can be copied and doesn't have to be hand or keyboard written  
- Done -

// Available Maps  
The latest project is a 90PT Game for the M-768-6-Metzel_v2 (HG) for the egypt nation - Uncompleted!  
There is also a project for the Amazons also on Metzel in progress by @Fleimy - Uncompleted!
